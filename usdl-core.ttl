An InteractionPoint can be initiated by the consumer or the provider. Since InteractionPoints may take time and have an ordering with respect to other InteractionPoints, this is a subclass of TimeSpanningEntity.
One can therefore express temporal relationships between InteractionPoints such as before or after. For richer expressions the time ontology constructs could be used.</p>"""@en  .
