    dc:description """<p>This vocabulary provides the core module of Linked USDL. It therefore covers the main concepts and relationships characterising services, leaving more specific aspects regarding some particular dimensions such as technical interfaces, licensing or security aside. These aspects will be covered in additional modules, or &nbsp;in some cases, like the technical interfaces, by existing vocabularies.</p>
<p>This first draft includes most of the original USDL specification with some useful simplifications. The vocabulary is, however, likely to be reorganised and better modularised as we progress.</p>

It should be noted that in the context of USDL, composites are only described, if they are defined on the “network-level”, i.e. they are compositions of entities exposed to the network. Thus, any composite implementation of a service that is internal to a provider, however arbitrarily complex it may be, is described as a fundamental service. The same applies to services with complex interaction structures, i.e. the interface exposed by such services spans across multiple interactions, as opposed to a single request/response invocation.";

    rdfs:comment "An Interaction represents actual communication between service consumer and service. On a technical level this could translate into calling a Web Service operation. On a professional level, it could mean that consumer and provider meet in person to exchange service parameters or resources involved in the service delivery (e.g. documents that are processed by the provider).<br> Interactions are the lowest-level building blocks of the interaction protocol and expose an atomic point of communication, which when enacted may lead to individual actions being performed. At least one agent partaking in the service's delivery is involved in the enactment of an interaction. This means a communication channel has to be provided and communication with the consumer has to be performed. Note: an interaction does not necessarily need to result in a service action (operation) to be performed. For example, a series of interactions might just collect input data from the consumer before one interaction finally triggers the action." .
